### 2018 American Water Resources Association Spring Specialty Conference:  GIS and Water Resources X

### Topical Session Proposal

**Title**: Open Science and the Monitoring of Aquatic Ecosystems

#### Description

Open science represents both a philosophy and a set of tools that can be leveraged for more effective scientific analysis.  At the core of the open science movement is the concept that research should be reproducible and transparent, in addition to having long-term provenance through effective modes of data preservation and sharing.  While most view the advantages of open science as providing free software applications, open science includes a much broader set of tools that can be adopted to improve scientific research.  Open science is critically important for fields of research that both collect and utilize monitoring data from aquatic ecosystems.  Techniques from open science can help technicians, researchers, and managers address key challenges of these data, including large volumes and types of information from multiple sources.  This session will provide a broad overview of general practices in open science and demonstrate specific applications to aquatic monitoring programs.  This session will also focus on key challenges in the adoption of open science techniques and dispel common criticisms that prevent widespread use of these tools.  Presenters will describe several applications to monitoring aquatic systems that include community standards for data management, techniques for data analysis, and modes of collaboration.  Our presenters represent federal, state, consulting, and academic interests to provide a comprehensive perspective on the use of open science across institutions.
